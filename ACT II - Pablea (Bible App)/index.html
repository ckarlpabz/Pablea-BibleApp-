					<dt>BIBLE</dt>
					<br>
					<dd>It has been reported for about 50 years that the Bible has been the largest seller of all books published in the history of the world.<br><br>The Bible was written by about 40 men in about 1,600 years--dating from 1500 B.C. to about A.D. 100. These men wrote as they were moved by the Holy Spirit (2 Pet. 1:21). They wrote not in words of human wisdom but in words taught by the Holy Spirit (1 Cor. 2:13).</dd>

					<dt>DATE OF WRITING</dt>
					<br>
					<dd>The entire Bible was written over a period of time consisting of about 1500 years. The first five books of the bible, known as the Pentateuch, are believed to have been written by Moses around 1400 BC, while the last book of the Bible named "The Revelation" is believed to have been written by the Apostle John shortly before 100 AD.<br>The writing of the OT was complete around 400 BC meaning the entire OT was written over a period of about 1000 years. In contrast, the New Testament was started shortly after the death of Jesus, and was finished some time before 100 ad spanning a much shorter period of about 50 to 60 years.</dd>
